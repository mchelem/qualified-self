## Introduction


The quantified self movement is a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. They regularly quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project we explore the "qualified self".

We use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants, to predict the manner 
in which they did the exercise. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. 
The [dataset](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) 
with 5 classes (sitting-down, standing-up, standing, walking, and sitting) collected on 8 hours of activities of 4 healthy subjects.

# Prepare the Data

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(caret)
trainingData <- read.csv("data/pml-training.csv")
predictors <- c(
  # Belt
  "roll_belt", "pitch_belt", "yaw_belt", "total_accel_belt", 
  "gyros_belt_x", "gyros_belt_y", "gyros_belt_z", 
  "accel_belt_x", "accel_belt_y", "accel_belt_z", 
  "magnet_belt_x", "magnet_belt_y", "magnet_belt_z", 
  
  # Arm
  "roll_arm", "pitch_arm", "yaw_arm", "total_accel_arm", 
  "gyros_arm_x", "gyros_arm_y", "gyros_arm_z", 
  "accel_arm_x", "accel_arm_y", "accel_arm_z", 
  "magnet_arm_x", "magnet_arm_y", "magnet_arm_z", 
  
  # Dumbbell
  "roll_dumbbell", "pitch_dumbbell", "yaw_dumbbell", "total_accel_dumbbell", 
  "gyros_dumbbell_x", "gyros_dumbbell_y", "gyros_dumbbell_z", 
  "accel_dumbbell_x", "accel_dumbbell_y", "accel_dumbbell_z", 
  "magnet_dumbbell_x", "magnet_dumbbell_y", "magnet_dumbbell_z"
)

# Cross validation
inTrain <- createDataPartition(trainingData$classe, p=0.8, list=FALSE)
training <- trainingData[inTrain, c(predictors, "classe")]
testing <- trainingData[-inTrain, c(predictors, "classe")]
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In a Principle Component Analysis one can see the data is not easily separable and, thus, a more complex model such as a random forest is likely to be the most suitable.

```{r, error=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(ggbiplot)
training.pca <- prcomp(training[1:39])
g <- ggbiplot(training.pca, obs.scale = 1, var.scale = 1, groups = training$classe, ellipse = TRUE, circle = TRUE)
g <- g + scale_color_discrete(name = '')
print(g)
```


## Model Fitting

Use a random forest model to fit the data.

```{r, error=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(randomForest)
model <- randomForest(training[,1:39], training$classe)
layout(matrix(c(1,2),nrow=1),
       width=c(4,1)) 
par(mar=c(5,4,4,0)) #No margin on the right side
plot(model, log="y")
par(mar=c(5,0,4,2)) #No margin on the left side
plot(c(0,1),type="n", axes=F, xlab="", ylab="")
legend("top", colnames(model$err.rate),col=1:4,cex=0.8,fill=1:4)
```

## Evaluating the Model

Evaluate the out of the sample error using the testing set.

```{r, error=TRUE, message=FALSE}
predictions <- predict(model, testing)
confusionMatrix(predictions, testing$classe)
```

## Predicting the Outcome

Predict the outcome applying the model to the new data set.

```{r}
testingData <- read.csv("data/pml-testing.csv")
predictions <- predict(model, testingData[,predictors])
predictions
```
